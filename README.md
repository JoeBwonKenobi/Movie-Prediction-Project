# Movie Project 3
 
 
 This was my Third and final projec twhilst attending Coding Dojo. For this project, I was required to produce a MySQL database on Movies from a subset of IMDB's publicly available dataset. Ultimately, I used this database to analyze what makes a movie successful and provided recommendations to the stakeholder on how to make a successful movie. There were serveral steps to completing this project and I split them up into separate notebooks since the file is so large.
 
Part 1: Download several files from IMDBâ€™s movie data set and filter out the subset of moves requested by the stakeholder.

Part 2: Use an API to extract box office revenue and profit data to add to your IMDB data and perform exploratory data analysis.

Part 3: Construct and export a MySQL database using your data.

Part 4: Apply hypothesis testing to explore what makes a movie successful.
